class GWRandomForestClassifier(BaseClassifier):
    """Geographically weighted random forest classifier

    Parameters
    ----------
    bandwidth : int | float
        bandwidth value consisting of either a distance or N nearest neighbors
    fixed : bool, optional
        True for distance based bandwidth and False for adaptive (nearest neighbor)
        bandwidth, by default False
    kernel : str | Callable, optional
        type of kernel function used to weight observations, by default "bisquare"
    include_focal : bool, optional
        Include focal in the local model training. Excluding it allows assessment of
        geographically weighted metrics on unseen data without a need for train/test
        split, hence providing value for all samples. This is needed for futher spatial
        analysis of the model performance (and generalises to models that do not support
        OOB scoring). However, it leaves out the most representative sample. By default
        False
    graph : Graph, optional
        Custom libpysal.graph.Graph object encoding the spatial interaction between
        observations. If given, it is used directly and `bandwidth`, `fixed`, `kernel`,
        and `include_focal` keywords are ignored.
    n_jobs : int, optional
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. ``-1`` means using all processors by
        default ``-1``
    fit_global_model : bool, optional
        Determines if the global baseline model shall be fitted alognside the
        geographically weighted, by default True
    measure_performance : bool | list, optional
        Calculate performance metrics for the model. If True, measures accuracy score,
        precision, recall, balanced accuracy, and F1 scores (based on focal prediction,
        pooled local out-of-bag predictions and individual local out-of-bag
        predictions). A subset of these can be specified by passing a list of strings.
        By default True
    strict : bool | None, optional
        Do not fit any models if at least one neighborhood has invariant ``y``, by
        default False. None is treated as False but provides a warning if there are
        invariant models.
    keep_models : bool | str | Path, optional
        Keep all local models (required for prediction), by default False. Note that for
        some models, like random forests, the objects can be large. If string or Path is
        provided, the local models are not held in memory but serialized to the disk
        from which they are loaded in prediction.
    temp_folder : str | None, optional
        Folder to be used by the pool for memmapping large arrays for sharing memory
        with worker processes, e.g., ``/tmp``. Passed to ``joblib.Parallel``, by default
        None
    batch_size : int | None, optional
        Number of models to process in each batch. Specify batch_size if your models do
        not fit into memory. By default None
    min_proportion : float, optional
        Minimum proportion of minority class for a model to be fitted, by default 0.2
    undersample : bool, optional
        Whether to apply random undersampling to balance classes, by default False
    random_state : int | None, optional
        Random seed for reproducibility, by default None
    verbose : bool, optional
        Whether to print progress information, by default False
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments passed to ``model`` initialisation
